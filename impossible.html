      Took a breath, let it go
      Felt the moment settle so
      I couln't wait to tell you why
      I'm standin' here with this awkward smile
      And that's because<br>
      I could drown myself in someone like you
      I could dive so deep I never come out
      I thought it was impossible
      But you make it possible<br>
      Love, it stings and then it laughs
      At every beat of my battered heart
      A sudden jolt, a tender kiss
      I know I'm gonna die of this
      And that's because<br>
      I could drown myself in someone like you
      I could dive so deep I never come out
      I thought it was impossible
      But you make it possible<br>
      I'll take the smooth with the rough
      Feels so fucked up to be in love
      Another day, another night
      Stuck in my own head but you pull me out
      You pull me out<br>
      I could drown myself in someone like you
      I could dive so deep I never come out
      I thought it was impossible
      But you make it possible<br>
      Somebody told me and I think they're right
      There is a change on its way tonight
      And I feel it's so
      But I fear it though<br>
      Somebody told me and I think they're right
      There is a change on its way tonight
      And I feel it's so
      And I feel it so<br>
      I could drown myself in someone like you
      I could dive so deep I never come out
      I thought it was impossible
      But you make it possible
